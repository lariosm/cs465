# Homework 2: Installing and improving the Wolfit app

The purpose of this homework is to

1. Get you up and running with the Wolfit sample application
2. Improve the test suite for the application to improve test coverage

## Part 1: Get Wolfit Running

You will clone the Wolfit repository to your development environment. You might consider starting by checking out the v0.1 release of the app which has a smaller code base and might be easier to navigate. Ultimately, you'll need to have your own version of the full v1.1 app running.

For full credit you will need to demonstrate that at least 10 posts are loaded into your Wolfit database. Hint -- the easiest way to do this will be using the ```load_reddit_posts.py``` script to load posts directly from Reddit.

## Part 2: Improve Wolfit's Test Coverage

Once you have the app running, run the full test suite and evaluate the current level of test coverage by invoking the ```cov.sh``` script. If you've properly installed the app you'll see a coverage report open up in your browser.

Your assignment is to improve the test coverage to at least 95%, with maximum credit offered if you get coverage to 100%.

_Notes:_

* You will need to have the [WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) installed to run the UI-based tests.
* You may find in some cases that code should be excluded from tests. 
* You are allowed (using the ```# pragma: no cover``` directive)
* You may exclude the ```load_reddit_posts.py``` from test coverage using the ```--omit``` flag when running coverage.

## Turning in your work

* Getting Wolfit Running
    * Commit a screenshot or video demonstrating that the app is running to the repository root directory.
* Improving test coverage
    * [Add a tag to your repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) at the point where you achieved your best test coverage, and share the URL for that tag.
    * Commit just the ```index.html``` generated by this report to your repository, as this will be enough for me to assess the improvement in coverage.
* Create a folder called ```evidence``` at the top level of this repository.
* Inside this folder, create a folder called ```hw2```. This is where you should place your screenshot or video as well as the coverage file.

If you do all of this properly, you need only submit the URL pointing to the tag within your repository containing all of the above.
